## General Information

- Provide general information about your project here.

  - Analyse the data provided by Consumer Finance Company which provides various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

  - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

  - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

  - If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

- What is the background of your project?

  - Understanding the defaulters who fails to pay the loan on time resulting in to credit loss for the Finance Company and avoid granting them loan for any future request.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

  - Avoid lending loans to Risky Customers and Identification of such applicants is the aim of our case study.

  - Need to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default further which company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment while lending loan to customer

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  - Loans.csv dataset is used for analysing defaulters or charged off customers
  - No of instances
  - No of attributes
  - The Data includes both categorical and numeric values, providing a diverse range of information about the listings.
