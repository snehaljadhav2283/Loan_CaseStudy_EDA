## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  
  * Analyse the data provided by Consumer Finance Company which provides various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

  * If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

  * If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

  * If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

- What is the background of your project?
  * Understanding the defaulters who fails to pay the loan on time resulting in to credit loss for the Finance Company and avoid granting them loan for any future request.
